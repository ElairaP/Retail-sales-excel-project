# Project in Excel Analysing Retail Sales
In this project I used excel to analyse and create visualisations on a dataset about the retail sales of a store. The dataset I used for this project was found on kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset, uploaded by Mohammad Talib.

## Data Preparation
- Used the remove duplicates feature in excel to check for and remove any identical data.
- Used filters on each column of the dataset to check for any incorrect data, typos, missing data etc.
- Used the TEXT function in excel to extract the day, month and year from the date column. I didn't end up using these columns but if the dataset had covered multiple years then these columns may have been useful to examine any trends in sales in particular months.

## Questions considered during analysing the data
- Are there any patterns in sales during particular time periods?
- Which categories are most popular among customers?
- Are there any patterns in age and amount spent?
- What is the distribution of prices within each category?

## Data analysis and Visualisation
- Created pivot tables to identify any patterns within the dataset.
- Made various types of charts depending on the content in the pivot table.
- Added slicers for some charts.
- Created a dashboard in excel to present these findings.
