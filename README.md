# Project in Excel Analysing Retail Sales
In this project I used excel to analyse and create visualisations on a dataset about the retail sales of a store. The dataset I used for this project was found on kaggle.

## Data Preparation
- After loading the csv file into excel I used the remove duplicates feature in excel to check for and remove any identical data.
- I used filters on each column of the dataset to check for any incorrect data, typos, missing data etc. so that I can fix any issues in the dataset.
- During the data cleaning process I found that the dataset taken from kaggle was already quite clean.
- I used the TEXT function in excel to extract the day, month and year from the date column. I didn't end up using these columns but if the dataset had covered multiple years then these columns may have been useful to examine any trends in sales in particular months.

## Questions I considered during analysing the data
- Are there any patterns in sales during particular time periods?
- Which categories are most popular among customers?
- Are there any patterns in age and amount spent?
- What is the distribution of prices within each category?

## Data analysis and Visualisation
- I created pivot tables to identify any patterns within the dataset.
- Depending on the content in the pivot table I made various types of charts.
- I also added slicers for some of the charts.
- For the pie charts I had to first extract the data from the pivot tables, calculate the proporions of the data and then convert them into a percentage.
- I had to format the labels on the axes on some of the charts to make it clearer to the audience what the chart is showing.
- Finally, I created a dashboard in excel to present these findings.
